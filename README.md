# Quadtree
A very basic zero-dependency* quadtree based on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41946007/.

This project has a minimal amount of testing and error handling, but should not yet
be considered safe, stable, or optimized.

(*) This project does have a dependency on `thiserror`, a macro for implementing custom
errors that adds no extra dependencies and is completely transparent to the public API.
